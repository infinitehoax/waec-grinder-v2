## 2026-05-17 - [Accessible Modal Focus & Keyboard Support]
**Learning:** In a Vanilla JS app where modals are toggled by adding/removing CSS classes (e.g., '.visible'), manual focus management and global keyboard listeners are necessary since the 'dialog' element's native behaviors aren't used.
**Action:** Always save the 'document.activeElement' before opening a modal and restore it upon closure. Use 'setTimeout' or direct '.focus()' on the close button to ensure keyboard users are not lost in the background DOM.
